Projects
1. Climate Change Impact on Agriculture
File: Climate_Change_Impact_on_Agriculture_.ipynb

This project explores the potential impacts of climate change on agricultural yields. It uses historical climate data and crop production statistics to analyze trends and build predictive models. The goal is to understand how factors like temperature, precipitation, and CO2 levels might affect food security and agricultural productivity in the future.

Key Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing of climate and agricultural datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify correlations and trends.

Statistical modeling and time-series analysis to predict crop yields.

Visualization of climate change indicators and their effects on agriculture.

2. Heart Failure Prediction using Deep Learning (ANN)
File: Heart_Failure_Prediction__Deep_Learning_ANN.ipynb

This project focuses on predicting heart failure using a Deep Learning approach with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Leveraging a dataset containing various medical parameters, the project aims to develop a robust model that can assist in early detection and risk assessment of heart failure, potentially leading to better patient outcomes.

Key Features:

Comprehensive data understanding and feature engineering.

Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras.

Model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Analysis of model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
